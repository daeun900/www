                     <p>In a world populated by anthropomorphic mammals, Judy Hopps, a rabbit from a rural town called Bunnyburrow, fulfils her childhood
                          dream of becoming the first rabbit police officer in the urban city of Zootopia. Despite being the academy valedictorian, Judy
                           is assigned to parking duty by Chief Bogo, who fails to recognize her talent.</p>

                 <div>
                     <p>On her first day on the job, Judy is hustled by a con artist fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick. The next day, a small-time crook 
                         and bootleg film seller named Duke Weaselton steals a bag of crocus bulbs known as Midnicampum holicithias. Judy abandons her
                          post to arrest Weaselton, and is reprimanded by Bogo. Mrs. Otterton unexpectedly barges into Bogo's office, pleading for someone
                           to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen missing mammals. Bogo has no choice but to agree, but secretly orders Judy to resign if she fails after forty-
                           eight hours.</p>

                 <div>
                     <p>Having ascertained that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy forces him into helping her by covertly recording his confession to 
                         tax evasion on her carrot pen. They track Emmitt's belongings to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, an arctic shrew whom Nick
                          has a history with. He reveals that Emmitt suddenly went "savage" and attacked Mr. Big's chauffeur Manchas, a black jaguar.</p>

                     <p>At City Hall, Bellwether offers Judy and Nick access to Zootopia's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was taken by timberwolves,
                          whom Judy surmises are the "Night Howlers". Following the wolves, the duo locates Emmitt, Manchas, and the other missing animals, 
                          who are now all "savage" predators, imprisoned at a local asylum. Zootopia's mayor, Leodore Lionheart, ordered their capture and is 
                          trying to ascertain the cause of their feral behavior. 
                         Lionheart and the asylum staff are soon arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.</p>

                     <p>Judy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. However, he angrily rejects her offer 
                         and abandons her after Judy claims that predatory biology is behind the mysterious "savageness"
                          epidemic. Judy's comments, broadcast on television, incite fear and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia.</p>

                     <p>Wracked with guilt, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow to manage her parent's vegetable stand.
                          There, she learns that "Night Howlers" are actually flowers with severe, lasting psychotropic effects that cause
                           mammals to essentially return to a feral state. 
                         Realizing they are the reason predators are becoming savages, Judy returns to Zootopia and reconciles with Nick. h the ZPD arrives.</p>
                 </div>
                 <div>
                     <p>Bellwether and her accomplices are arrested. The still-imprisoned Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of her plot and claims 
                         that imprisoning the infected predators was a "wrong thing for the right reason". With the cause of the epidemic identified, 
                         the predators are cured and Judy is 
                         reinstated into the ZPD. Months later, Nick graduates from the police academy, becoming her partner and the first fox police officer.</p>
